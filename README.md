I analyzed the web server log from NASA_access_log_Jul95. See the graphs before to see what the information for the data collected. 


## Graph __blank__ data

The first thing I analyzed was the flow of traffic via the frequency of DNS addresses. A DNS turns domain names into IP addresses, which allows browsers to get to websites and tells us whats happening on their network. This is what I found: 
piweba3y.prodigy.com visited the most. 
Must users visited over 7500 times

The second thing I analyzed was the web page visits dates. Analyzing the date gives us a better understanding of how often users access the web page This is what I found: 
July 13 1995 had the most visits
July 13 1995 had around 130000 visits
July 28 1995 had the least visits
